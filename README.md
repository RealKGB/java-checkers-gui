# java-checkers-gui
GUI version of my CLI checkers, written in Java. Uses StdDraw for graphics.

It uses [java-checkers-cli](https://github.com/RealKGB/java-checkers-cli) as a base, and adds GUI elements on top of it.

Currently you can view a visual representation of the checkerboard, but the game still has to be played via cli. Next is supporting interaction with the gui.
Once interaction is supported, animations instead of checkers simply teleporting to the new spot should be possible.
