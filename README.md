# java-checkers-gui
GUI version of my CLI checkers, written in Java. Uses StdDraw for graphics.

It uses [java-checkers-cli](https://github.com/RealKGB/java-checkers-cli) as a base, and adds GUI elements on top of it.

Currently you can view a visual representation of the checkerboard and move checkers with point-and-clic, but some actions must be done via cli. See latest commit for details
