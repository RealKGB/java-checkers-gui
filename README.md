# java-checkers-gui
GUI version of my CLI checkers, written in Java. Uses StdDraw for graphics.

It uses [java-checkers-cli](https://github.com/RealKGB/java-checkers-cli) as a base, and adds GUI elements on top of it.

Latest release supports viewing a visual representation of the board only.
Latest commit fully supports playing checkers with point-and-click, provided you compile it yourself.
It still has some logic bugs.
